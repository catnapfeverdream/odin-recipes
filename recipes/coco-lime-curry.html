    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Going back to an old favorite of mine here. And I definitely shouldn't be created a recipes database while I'm hungry because my mouth is watering and my stomach is growling...</p> 
        
        <p>This recipe creates a beautiful, aromatic curry sauce that is best served with homemade naan, some fluffy rice, and a protein of choice - my personal favorite is tofu as this recipe calls for, but since it's ultra-processed, my healthy brain says cauliflower is a good alternative.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 tbsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, sliced/diced</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>knob of ginger, grated</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp red curry paste</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp sriracha/hot sauce</li>
            <li>250-300 ml coconut milk</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
            <li>juice of 1 lemon or lime</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gently heat 1-2 tbsp of sesame oil in a pan and fry firm tofu slices until golden brown on both sides. <em>Optional: coat the tofu slices lightly in corn flour for a more crisp and golden texture.</em></li>
            <li>Remove the tofu and set aside. In the same pan, stir in 1 tbsp sesame oil, sliced/diced onion, minced garlic, grated ginger, red curry paste, and the hot sauce.</li>
            <li>Stir it all together and, once fragrant, add the coconut milk and then stir in: brown sugar, light soy sauce, and the juice of the lemon or lime - dealer's choice!</li>
            <li>Once simmering, add back the cooked tofu and stir it all around for good measure. Garnish with scallions and sesame seeds, serve over rice, and eat your heart out.</li>
        </ol>
