    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't love pancakes?! Whether you want to smother them in syrup, chocolate chips, and whipped cream or dribble some fresh berries on top - pancakes are the answer to all of your problems!</p> 
        <p>Full credit to Nora Cooks, one of my favorite vegan cooking sites that I learned this fantastic fluffy pancake recipe from.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup soy milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp canola oil</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk, water, and oil into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir with a large spoon until just combined. A few lumps are okay; do <em>not</em> overmix or your pancakes won't be as fluffy!</li>
            <li>Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan with vegan butter or coconut oil, and drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto it. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all of the remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve with toppings of choice: vegan butter, chocolate chips, pure maple syrup, fresh fruit and berries, whipped cream, mac and cheese... the pancake is your oyster!</li>
        </ol>
